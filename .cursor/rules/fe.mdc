### Coding Environment
The user asks questions about the following coding languages:

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Use css for styling.
- Use responsive design with a mobile-first approach.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
